Hey there, I'm [Danny] (http://www.dannyrosen.net). I'm a QA Guy [@Sailthru] (http://www.github.com/sailthru) and these are my [dotfiles] (http://dotfiles.github.com/).

I'm using:

* 	[homeshick] (https://github.com/andsens/homeshick) - for bringing down the dotfiles
*	[vundle] (https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) - for managing my vim plugins

*	[zsh] (https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) - for extending my zsh 

*   [ack-grep] (http://beyondgrep.com/) - for going above and beyond grep
