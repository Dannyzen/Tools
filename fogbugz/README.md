<h4>Fogbugz Tools</h4>
Lots of good things here in here:
-fogbugz_milestone.py - changes all tickets with milestone n to have milestone y
-fogbugz_stats.py - given a milestone, outputs how many tickets are in it. can (and should) be expanded for future functionality.
-round_robin.py - Credits to @ericmedvec who helped with this. It's our round robin script that distributes tickets to us in an equal fashion.
timer.py- a command line driven fogbugz timer script.
